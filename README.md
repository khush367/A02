2. Clone- The process of creating a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.

3. Commit- A commit is a snapshot of the changes made to the codebase at a specific point in time.

4. Fetch- to get changes from a remote repository without automatically merging them.

5. GIT- A distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. Git allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously while keeping track of changes.

6. Github- A platform that provides hosting for software development projects using Git. GitHub facilitates collaboration, code review, and project management, making it a popular open-source and private repository platform.

7. Merge- The process of combining changes from one branch into another. This typically involves incorporating the changes made in a feature branch into the main branch.

8. Merge Conflict- A situation that occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes made on different branches. Manual intervention is required to resolve conflicting changes before merging.
9. Push- The process of uploading local changes to a remote repository. This makes the changes accessible to others and updates the repository's history.

10. Pull- the process of getting changes from a remote repository and automatically merging them into the current local branch.

11. Remote- a version of a Git repository that is hosted on a server rather than on a local machine. Developers can interact with the remote repository by pushing changes to it or pulling changes from it.
