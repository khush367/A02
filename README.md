First, install Git and create a GitHub account. When creating a new project on your local machine using git, you'll first create a new repository. Add a new file to the project, using any text editor you like or running a touch command. `touch newfile.txt` just creates and saves a blank file named newfile.txt. Add a file to the staging environment using the git add command. Run the command git commit -m "Your message about the commit". Finally, create a new branch. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository, and run git checkout -b <my branch name>. This command will automatically create a new branch and then 'check you out' on it, meaning git will move you to that branch, off of the primary branch.



1. Branch- A separate line of development within a Git repository. Changes made in one branch do not affect other branches until explicitly merged.

2. Clone- The process of creating a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.

3. Commit- A commit is a snapshot of the changes made to the codebase at a specific point in time.

4. Fetch- to get changes from a remote repository without automatically merging them.

5. GIT- A distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. Git allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously while keeping track of changes.

6. Github- A platform that provides hosting for software development projects using Git. GitHub facilitates collaboration, code review, and project management, making it a popular open-source and private repository platform.

7. Merge- The process of combining changes from one branch into another. This typically involves incorporating the changes made in a feature branch into the main branch.

8. Merge Conflict- A situation that occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes made on different branches. Manual intervention is required to resolve conflicting changes before merging.
9. Push- The process of uploading local changes to a remote repository. This makes the changes accessible to others and updates the repository's history.

10. Pull- the process of getting changes from a remote repository and automatically merging them into the current local branch.

11. Remote- a version of a Git repository that is hosted on a server rather than on a local machine. Developers can interact with the remote repository by pushing changes to it or pulling changes from it.

12. Repository-  is a collection of files and version history managed by Git. It can be hosted locally or on a remote server like GitHub, and it stores the entire history of changes made to the project.
